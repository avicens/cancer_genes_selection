To indentify cancer genes under positive selection in specific lineages, I conducted *Branch-Site tests* of positive selection. 

## Branch-site models
Branch-site tests compare neutral and selection site-models on each branch in the phylogeny. In this case, we just analyzed the terminal branches leading to each lineage (internal branches were not evaluated). 
I run the analysis using ETE3 package (Huerta-Cepas et al. 2016) and jobs were submitted to the *CESGA* computing cluster.

```{bash, bs_test, eval=FALSE}
#!bin/bash
                              
WORKDIR="/mnt/lustre/scratch/home/uvi/be/avs/cancer_genes_selection"
GENEDIR="${WORKDIR}/genes"

gene=`ls ${GENEDIR} | sed "${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}q;d"`

module load miniconda
source activate /home/uvi/be/avs/lustre/tools/miniconda_avs

echo "Running Codeml for ${gene}"
$TMPDIR} --resume > ${GENEDIR}/${gene}/paml/${gene}_bs_test.out
```
